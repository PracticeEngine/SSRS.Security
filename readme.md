# SSRS.Security for Practice Engine

This repository contains SSRS Custom Security implementations that work with [Practice Engine](http://www.practice-engine.com) for firms using that software.  The security mechanism is built to work against the [Identity Server 4](https://identityserver.io/) which Practice Engine leverages.

We encourage the community to log issues and bugs here, and we encourage the community of developers to submit pull requests to add or enhance this (such as adding additional support for other versions).  We would also welcome others who may have a need for a pure-OpenIdConnect implementation (which could be used directly against Azure AD for example).
